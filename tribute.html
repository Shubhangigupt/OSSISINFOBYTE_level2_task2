		br><br> 
        ☛ His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community.
		<br><br> 
        ☛ In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called <b> Technology Vision 2020 </b>, which he describedas a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years.

		<br><br> 
        ☛ Kalam received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from <b>40</b> universities. The Government of India honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.
		<br><br> 
        ☛ In 1997, Kalam received India's highest Civilian honour, the <b> Bharat Ratna </b>, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India.
		br><br>

		<br><br> 
		☛ Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September 2015.
		<br><br>
